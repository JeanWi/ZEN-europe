# Industry heat sectors

Sectors `industry_heat`, `industry_tes` and `industry_dsm` (`zen_europe/elements/sectors/`).
Input data are computed in `IndustryProductionData` (`industry_production_data.py`) and
`IndustryHeatSupply` (`industry_heat_supply.py`) in `zen_europe/datasets/dataset_collections/`.

## Structure

- **Sectors**: glass, ceramic, paper, food. Each has a product carrier and a
  `<sector>_production` technology. Cement, steel and chemicals are part of the main model.
- **Heat bands**: heat < 200 °C is split into `heat_industry_{0_100,100_150,150_200}_<sector>`,
  so heat pump efficiency (COP) depends on the band. Heat > 200 °C is a direct fuel input
  of the production technology.
- **Per-sector heat chain**: boilers, heat pumps, cascade, kiln fuel and TES are defined
  per sector (`<name>_<sector>`), so heat cannot be exchanged between sectors.
- **Not in the default dataset**: the three sectors are not part of the default
  `structure.set_sectors`; they are switched on per variant in `data/models.yaml`. The
  generated model-structure pages and the statement in the model structure overview that
  the default dataset includes all sectors therefore cover only the default sectors.
- **Sector links**: `industry_heat` requires `electricity`, `gas`, `hydrogen` and
  `district_heating`. `glass_post_comb` and `ceramic_post_comb` are also declared by
  `carbon` and `cement` and only added when both are active. Each `*_DSM` is declared by
  `industry_dsm` and by the sector of its product (`industry_heat`, `ammonia`, `cement`,
  `methanol` or `steel`).

### Settings (`industry.*`, `zen_europe/settings/industry.py`)

| setting | default | use |
|---|---|---|
| `data_year` | 2023 | year of production, energy and heat statistics |
| `operating_hours` | 8000 | full-load hours of production plants and boilers |
| `fuel_share_cutoff` | 0.10 | minimum fuel share in the > 200 °C fuel mix |
| `capacity_limit_margin` | 2.0 | capacity limit of pass-through technologies (× demand) |
| `hp_seed_years` | 15 | build-out years of DH heat pumps for the heat pump seed |
| `hp_share_first_year` | 0.02 | first-year heat pump cap (share of band demand) |
| `min_boiler_capacity` | 0.005 GW | existing boiler capacity per node below this is set to 0 |
| `dsm_shiftability` | `optimistic` | DSM category column |

### General assumptions

Own numeric assumptions of the industry sectors (heat pump COP, waste-heat recovery cost,
process CO2, kiln switchable share, and the technical parameters of the temperature
cascade, TES and DSM) are in
`data/raw_data/03-technology/industry/general_assumptions_industries.csv`
(`IndustryGeneralAssumptions`), each with its reasoning and sources.

### Scenarios (`data/models.yaml`, generated with `zen-europe --all`)

| scenario | change |
|---|---|
| base (no industrial heat, TES or DSM) | `zen_europe_base` |
| full flexibility | `zen_europe_ind_heat_v1_full_flexibility` |
| no flexibility / TES only / DSM only | remove `industry_tes` and/or `industry_dsm` |
| no diffusion | `investment.use_diffusion_rates: false` |
| DSM pessimistic | DSM only (removes `industry_tes`) with `industry.dsm_shiftability: pessimistic` |
| single temperature (`_single_temp`) | removes the 0–100 and 100–150 °C heat pumps. Lower bands are served via the cascade |

## Product demand and existing capacity

Demand (t/h) = existing production capacity ÷ `operating_hours`. Net trade is not
modeled. Existing boilers and the cascade are based on this demand; the waste heat limit
and the existing kiln fuel capacity on annual average production (JRC-IDEES output ÷ 8760 h).

| sector | basis |
|---|---|
| glass, paper | JRC-IDEES-2023 installed capacity |
| ceramic | JRC-IDEES thermal final energy ÷ Rehfeldt weighted fuel intensity |
| food | Rehfeldt EU28+3 activity per sub-process, distributed to nodes by FAOSTAT production of a proxy item (`FOOD_ITEMS`) |

**Nodes without JRC-IDEES** (CH, NO, UK; `NODES_WITHOUT_IDEES`):

- glass, ceramic: CH = AT, NO = FI, UK = DE × population UK/DE in `industry.data_year`
  (World Bank, `WorldBankPopulation`);
- paper: 2008 *consumption* from JRC BAT Paper (2015), Table 1.2 (CH 1,397, NO 831,
  UK 11,443 kt). No existing boilers or waste heat at these nodes;
- food: FAOSTAT covers all nodes.

**Vintages**: existing capacity is today's capacity in `reference_year - 1`, spread over
the construction years with the shared `calculate_capacity_addition_from_cumulative` and
`format_capacity_existing` (`zen_europe/utils/utils.py`), as for all other technologies.
With `investment.use_existing_capacities: false` the industry technologies have no
existing capacity. Heat pumps, TES and DSM have no existing capacity.

## Production technologies

**Energy intensity**: glass from AIDRES (natural gas route), ceramic/paper/food from
Rehfeldt (2017), weighted by sub-process activity. Temperature mapping of fuel demand:

| Rehfeldt bin | model |
|---|---|
| < 100 °C | 0–100 °C band |
| 100–200 °C | 100–150 / 150–200 °C, split by Wolf (2017), Table 4-7 |
| > 200 °C | direct fuel input |

**Fuel mix > 200 °C**: EU27 JRC-IDEES thermal final energy mix per sector, mapped via
`FUELS` (natural gas → `natural_gas`, solids → `hard_coal`, biomass and waste →
`biomass`, other liquids → `oil`). Shares below `fuel_share_cutoff` are dropped and the
rest renormalized.

**Costs**: JRC-EU-TIMES values (EUR2006), the ceramic proxy (EUR2014) and the food costs
are inflated to `time.reference_year` with the ECB HICP (`ECBInflation`), as all other
costs, and converted from EUR/(t/yr) to EUR/(t/h) (× 8760, rated capacity; as for all other
technologies). Variable O&M excludes energy. **Process CO2** (`carbon_intensity` in the general assumptions) covers
non-combustion emissions only.

| sector | cost source | capex | fixed O&M | var. O&M | lifetime | process CO2 (t/t) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| glass | JRC `IGHHOLLOW01`, `IGFFLATGL01` | 2.34 M EUR/(t/h) | 178 k EUR/(t/h)/yr | 64 EUR/t | 28 yr | 0.1 |
| ceramic | Gardarsdóttir et al. (2019) clinker plant (`CementProductionGardarsdottir`) | 1.83 M EUR/(t/h) | 136 k EUR/(t/h)/yr | 7.5 EUR/t | 25 yr | 0.0642 |
| paper | JRC `IPPHIGQUA01`, `IPPLOWQUA01`, `IPPPUPCHE01`; capex override from literature | 700 EUR/(t/yr) | JRC | JRC | JRC | 0 |
| food | literature | 300 EUR/(t/yr) | 15 EUR/(t/yr)/yr | 0 | 20 yr | 0 |

The literature costs of paper and food are in
`data/raw_data/03-technology/industry/industry_production_costs.csv`
(`IndustryProductionCosts`), together with their sources.

### Glass

- Routes container/flat/fibre, weighted 60/30/10 % (AIDRES EU mix); the weights are also
  applied to Rehfeldt temperature distributions, JRC costs and kiln fuel factors.
- Fibre uses `IGFFLATGL01` (same continuous-melt furnace; no JRC fibre process).
- Process CO2 = direct emission of the AIDRES electricity route (raw-material decomposition).

### Ceramic

- Rehfeldt sub-processes: tiles 5.46, technical 12.11, houseware 24.24 GJ/t.
- No ceramic cost data exist; the costs and lifetime of the cement clinker plant
  (`CementProductionGardarsdottir`, as `cement_kiln`) are used as a kiln-fired mineral proxy.
- Process CO2 from the JRC BAT share of process emissions (15 % of total): combustion
  = 8.036 GJ/t × 0.0453 t/GJ (fuel-mix weighted) ≈ 0.364 t/t; process = 0.364 × 15/85
  ≈ 0.0642 t/t.

### Paper

- Sub-processes paper, recovered fibres, chemical pulp (95.2 % of activity; weights
  56.1/28.9/15.0 %). Mechanical pulp excluded.
- Capex override: JRC (~2,283 EUR/(t/yr)) describes an integrated greenfield mill.
  700 EUR/(t/yr) is a lower bound from brownfield conversions: Stora Enso Oulu 2026
  (~1,333), Langerbrugge 2022 (~571), Kotkamills BM2 2016 (~425–450 EUR/(t/yr)).
- Lime kiln calcination of kraft pulping is not included.

### Food

- Rehfeldt sub-processes dairy, meat, brewing, bakery, sugar (bakery and sugar carry
  the > 200 °C demand).
- No consistent food cost data exist. Costs are rounded from three mid-sized JRC processes
  (hollow glass, quicklime, copper finishing), as food plants are mostly low-temperature
  processing lines.

## Kiln fuel switching

The > 200 °C natural gas of glass and ceramic is routed through `fuel_to_kiln_<sector>`,
supplied by `natural_gas_to_kilnfuel`, `hydrogen_to_kilnfuel` and
`electricity_to_kilnfuel`. These model fuel choice only and have no costs; lifetime of the
`cement_kiln` (as `*_to_cement_fuel`). Coal, biomass and oil shares remain fixed inputs.

- **Switchable share** (`kiln_switchable_share` in the general assumptions): glass 100 %, ceramic 97.4 %; the
  remainder is a fixed `natural_gas` input.
- **Existing capacity**: `natural_gas_to_kilnfuel` at today's kiln gas flow, with
  capacity limit (see [Diffusion](#diffusion)). Alternatives start at 0 with the
  Mannhardt `MEDIUM` diffusion rate.
- **Conversion factors** (`KILN_FUEL_INPUT`, `aidres.py`): AIDRES route fuel use
  relative to the natural gas route; for electricity, the baseline auxiliary electricity
  (already in the production technology) is subtracted. Ceramic uses the glass factors
  (no data in the ceramic BREF).

  | route (weight) | NG GJ/t | H2 GJ/t | H2/NG | elec. − baseline GJ/t | elec/NG |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | container (60 %) | 4.73 | 5.04 | 1.0655 | 5.09 − 1.07 = 4.02 | 0.8499 |
  | flat (30 %) | 5.43 | 5.78 | 1.0645 | 5.41 − 0.80 = 4.61 | 0.8490 |
  | fibre (10 %) | 7.24 | 7.17 | 0.9903 | 7.89 − 2.16 = 5.73 | 0.7914 |
  | **weighted** | | | **1.0577** | | **0.8438** |

### Ceramic switchable share

The ceramic BREF (JRC-BAT-CER-2026, §4.2.1–4.2.3) limits electrified kilns to < 1600 °C.
Tiles and houseware fire at 1000–1400 °C (fully switchable); the > 1000 °C bin of
technical ceramics is treated as not switchable (worst case).

| sub-process | fuel GJ/t | activity Mt | fuel PJ | < 1000 °C PJ | > 1000 °C PJ | not switchable PJ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| tiles | 5.46 | 4.66 | 25.44 | 10.94 | 14.50 | – |
| technical | 12.11 | 0.68 | 8.23 | 7.00 | 1.23 | 1.23 |
| houseware | 24.24 | 0.57 | 13.82 | 4.84 | 8.98 | – |
| **total** | | | **47.49** | | | **1.23** |

Switchable = 46.26 / 47.49 ≈ 97.4 %. Limitations: the BREF gives no temperature limit for
hydrogen (§4.2.4), so the locked share is optimistic; natural gas is assumed to
follow the sector's fuel temperature distribution; coal co-firing for some facing bricks
(§4.1.6.3.5) is not included. The value is a technical ceiling: current adoption is
negligible (BREF Table 3-201: 6 electrified, 1 hydrogen of 199 plants).

## Post-combustion capture

`glass_post_comb` and `ceramic_post_comb` retrofit the production technologies analogous
to `cement_post_comb`.

- Source: DEA carbon capture catalogue, sheet "401.c Post comb - Cement kiln". Costs
  and lifetime via the technology cost database with `cement_post_comb` as proxy;
  conversion factors and capture rate are DEA 2020 values.
  `capacity_addition_unbounded` and `max_diffusion_rate` as `cement_post_comb`.
- Heat input from `natural_gas` and `hard_coal` in the sector's ratio of these fuels.
- Captured CO2 = process CO2 × 0.9 (as cement: 0.54 × 0.9 = 0.486 t/t). Combustion CO2
  is not captured, for consistency with cement.

## Heat supply

### Boilers

Six boilers per sector (biomass, natural gas, oil, electrode, coal, waste) supply the
150–200 °C band. Data from DEA "Technology Data for Industrial Process Heat" (`DEA`),
mean of lower/central/upper estimates, rebased from 2025 EUR via the technology cost
database. Costs are interpolated over 2025–2050 and held constant before 2025; variable
O&M changes via `opex_specific_variable_yearly_variation`.

| boiler | DEA sheet | capex (EUR/kW) | fixed O&M (EUR/kW/yr) | var. O&M (EUR/MWh) | lifetime | efficiency |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| electrode | 5.1a electric boiler, steam, 2 MW | 250 | 1.44 | 0.674 | 25 | 99 % |
| natural gas, oil | 6.1 boiler, gas and oil, 5 MW | 90 | 2.0 | 1.23 | 25 | 94 % |
| biomass | 6.2 boiler, biomass, 6.5 MW | 878 | 39.5 | 1.45 | 25 | 89 % |
| coal | 6.3 boiler, coal, 5 MW | 565 | 40.0 | 1.45 | 25 | 90 % |
| waste | – (as `waste_boiler_DH`) | 1,295 | 16.8 | 1.45 | 30 | 94 % |

Central values, 2025 EUR. Waste: no DEA industrial sheet; values of `waste_boiler_DH`
(capex: mean of DEA and EU Reference Scenario 2020; O&M: EU Reference Scenario 2020),
year 2025 in 2022 EUR. The 2 MW electrode boiler is used instead of 15 MW
(110 EUR/kW), which would undercut the gas boiler capex.

### Heat pumps

Per sector: three bands × two sources (waste heat, water). No existing capacity.

| | 0–100 °C | 100–150 °C | 150–200 °C |
|---|---|---|---|
| sink temperature | 75 °C | 125 °C | 175 °C |
| COP, waste heat (50 °C) | 6.96 | 2.65 | 1.79 |
| COP, water (15 °C) | 2.90 | 1.81 | 1.40 |
| capex (DEA) | 2.a, 1,200 EUR/kW | 2.b, 1,550 EUR/kW | 2.b, 1,550 EUR/kW |

- COP = 0.5 × Carnot; source temperatures from Bever (2024) and Agora (2023). Lifetime 20 yr.
- Waste-heat variants add 1,500 EUR/kW for heat recovery (`waste_heat_recovery_capex`),
  based on Stark et al. (2025), Table 2 (~1,234–1,645 EUR/kW).
- Water-source heat pumps are unlimited; waste-heat heat pumps are limited by the
  [waste heat limit](#waste-heat-limit).

### Temperature cascade

`heat_industry_temp_conversion_{150,100}_<sector>` pass heat to the next lower band
without losses or costs. Existing capacity = lower-band demand; capacity limit = demand ×
`capacity_limit_margin`. Lifetime 30 yr (`temp_cascade_lifetime`).

### Existing boiler fleet

Existing boiler capacity per node = heat demand of all four sectors (product demand
× heat intensity), split by fuel and sector.

**Fuel shares**: Eurostat gross heat production (`nrg_bal_c`, 2023).

- oil = "Oil and petroleum products" (fuel oil alone gives 1.0 % vs. 4.6 % EU share;
  Fraunhofer 2012: 7.4 %);
- coal and waste included; biogas added to biomass; manufactured gases and minor
  carriers excluded;
- CH: BFE (2025), 2023, branches 1, 3, 6 (gas 64.7 %, oil 17.7 %, biomass 8.3 %,
  waste 7.1 %, coal 2.2 %);
- UK: Eurostat 2019;
- no data: 100 % natural gas.

**Sector split**: per node, a sector × fuel matrix is fitted by iterative proportional
fitting (`_fit_fuel_matrix`): rows sum to the Eurostat/BFE fuel totals, columns to the
sector heat demands. Starting values are the sector's JRC-IDEES fuel mix in that country
(EU27 for CH/NO/UK; `IDEES_BOILER_FUELS`). Electrode boilers are split by heat demand.

**Cut-off**: node totals below `min_boiler_capacity` are set to 0 (removes 255 of 500
entries, 0.7 % of capacity). Capacity can still be built.

## Waste heat limit

Waste-heat heat pumps use only the > 200 °C exhaust heat of their own sector at the node,
distributed over bands by heat demand:

    capacity_limit[s, band, n] = production[s, n] × fuel_intensity_>200°C[s] × heat[s, band] / Σ heat[s, :]

The limit is applied to heat pump output; the physical bound (× COP/(COP − 1)) is
1.17–2.26× larger. EU totals (GW, glass/ceramic/paper/food): 0–100 °C
0.48/6.57/0.02/0.67; 100–150 °C 1.56/1.92/0.43/0.22; 150–200 °C 3.12/3.84/0.27/0.24.

Validation against Heat Roadmap Europe (Mathiesen et al.), 2015, non-metallic minerals +
paper:

| node | model (GW) | HRE (GW) | ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| DE | 3.45 | 3.87 | 0.89 |
| FR | 1.82 | 2.42 | 0.75 |
| HU | 0.18 | 0.26 | 0.68 |
| PL | 1.36 | 1.58 | 0.86 |
| ES | 2.10 | 2.38 | 0.88 |

## Diffusion

ZEN-garden limits capacity additions per period (`constraint_technology_diffusion_limit_total`)
to the sum of (1) own capacity × `max_diffusion_rate`, (2) 2 % of the capacity of all
technologies with the same class and reference carrier, and (3)
`capacity_addition_unbounded`. New industry heat technologies take the diffusion rate of a
proxy (`diffusion_proxy`): boilers and heat pumps that of their district heating counterpart,
alternative kiln fuels that of `hydrogen_to_cement_fuel`, post-combustion capture that of
`cement_post_comb` (all `MEDIUM` in `TechnologyDiffusionMannhardt`).

- **Heat pump seed** (`capacity_addition_unbounded`): annual `heat_pump_DH` build-out
  (fleet / `hp_seed_years`) × `interval_between_years`, split by the sector-band share of
  EU industry heat demand, by heat source and by node. Summed over nodes, all industry heat
  pumps share one DH build-out per period. Required for feasibility. `hp_seed_years` = 15
  ≈ fleet / recent DH additions (~0.15 GW/yr).
- **First-year heat pump cap** (`capacity_limit`): in the reference year, at most
  `hp_share_first_year` (2 %) of the band demand per node, split by heat source (no
  industrial heat pumps today). Without it, term (2) alone allows ~8 % of the demand.
- **Pass-through technologies** (cascade, `natural_gas_to_kilnfuel`) share the reference
  carrier with heat pumps and alternative kiln fuels. Without capex or limit, their
  capacity would inflate term (2), so they get existing capacity and `capacity_limit` =
  flat demand × `capacity_limit_margin` (2.0, ~10 % above the max. peak-to-mean ratio of
  1.80; must be > 1).
- Heat pump market-share peers are the boilers and cascade of the same sector.

## Thermal energy storage

Per sector: water tanks (0–100, 100–150 °C) and a steam accumulator (150–200 °C). Costs
and lifetimes from Mayer et al. (2024), Table 3; self-discharge from Brown et al. (2018),
Table 1. No existing capacity.

| | water tank | steam accumulator |
|---|---|---|
| capex (EUR/kWh) | 10 | 114 |
| fixed O&M (EUR/kWh/yr) | 0.15 | 4.1 |
| variable O&M (EUR/GWh) | 1 | 1 |
| lifetime (yr) | 30 | 25 |
| energy-to-power ratio (h) | 1–24 | 0.25–4 |
| charge/discharge efficiency | 1 | 1 |
| self-discharge | 1.38 %/h (τ = 3 d) | 1.38 %/h (τ = 3 d) |

Self-discharge per hour = 1 − exp(−1/(24τ)), with τ = 3 d of decentral hot water tanks
(`Brown2018_Table1.csv`), also used for steam accumulators. (Dis)charging losses are
neglected; variable O&M prevents spurious cycling.

## Demand-side management

DSM is modeled as product storage (`industry_DSM.py`) for glass, ceramic, paper, food,
ammonia, clinker, methanol, primary and secondary steel, and olefin. Each product has a
shiftability category (`DSMLiteratureReview`, read from
`data/raw_data/03-technology/industry/dsm_shiftability_categories.csv`) with parameters
in `dsm_category_parameters.csv` (internal assumptions):

| category | meaning | storage and variable cost (EUR/t) | max. horizon (h) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | not flexible | 1,000 | 2 |
| 2 | partially flexible | 20 | 48 |
| 3 | fully flexible | 1 | 336 |

| product | pess. | opt. | reason | sources |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| glass | 1 | 1 | continuous furnace campaigns of 5–15 yr | Hubert 2015; Hongtai 2024 |
| ceramic | 1 | 2 | tunnel kilns continuous; batch kilns can stop between cycles | Tangram |
| paper | 2 | 3 | mechanical pulping with pulp storage | Helin et al. 2017 |
| food | 1 | 2 | industry interview | Perez Recatala (ongoing) |
| methanol | 2 | 3 | power-to-methanol can ramp | Schneider & Lagoni 2023; Chen & Yang 2021 |
| primary steel | 1 | 1 | blast furnaces barely vary | Boldrini et al. 2024; Golmohamadi 2021 |
| secondary steel | 2 | 3 | EAF load flexibility | Boldrini et al. 2024; Golmohamadi 2021 |
| olefin | 1 | 2 | electrified crackers allow part load | Tiggeloven et al. 2023 |
| ammonia | 1 | 2 | flexible Haber–Bosch designs reach 10 % turndown | Salmon & Bañares-Alcántara 2023; Fahr et al. 2025 |
| clinker | 1 | 1 | "uninterruptible" | Golmohamadi 2021, Table 5 |

- Ammonia and methanol are in GW: costs per tonne are divided by the energy content
  (`Constants.AMMONIA_GWH_PER_TON`, `Constants.METHANOL_KWH_PER_KG`).
- Efficiency 0.999 (prevents simultaneous charge/discharge), self-discharge 0.
- Capacity limit = product demand per node. Lifetime 50 yr, minimum energy-to-power ratio 0.

## Carbon emissions budget

Budget per Mannhardt (2026): IPCC AR6 remaining budget, per-capita share, scaled to the
emission share of modeled sectors. With `industry_heat`, the four sectors are added to the
modeled sectors (2022 limit: ~+5.5 %).

| region | source | categories |
|---|---|---|
| EU | EEA/UNFCCC CRF (`eea_ghg_inventory.py`) | `1.A.2.d` paper, `1.A.2.e` food, `1.A.2.f` glass/ceramic combustion, `2.A.3` glass, `2.A.4` ceramics |
| UK glass, ceramic | DESNZ (`desnz_ghg_inventory.py`) | "Glass production", "Bricks production", "Other ceramics" |
| UK paper, food | ONS (2026) (`ons_industry_emissions.py`) | SIC 17; SIC 10–12 |
